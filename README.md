# FocusFinder

FocusFinder was a group final project as part of the Makers Software Development Bootcamp in March 2025.

With 2-weeks, 4 team members, and the topic 'Learning', we decided to create a website in C# called FocusFinder.

Co-workers: [Fliss Douglas](https://github.com/Flissd1795), [Ben Loveday](https://github.com/StrawberryScot), and [Arthur Botto](https://github.com/arthurbotto).


# About FocusFinder
FocusFinder is a web application designed to showcase locations around the UK that would be considered ideal study spots based on the user and their preferences.

The idea was that our application, if/when live, would not only be ideal for those seeking a study spot, but also for anyone looking for a quiet space or a place to relax or work on other activities.

## Technologies Used
- C#
- ASP.NET
- HTML
- CSS
- Razor
- PostgreSQL
- NUnit
- Playwright
- Render


For myself, I primarily worked with C#, HTML and .net for this project, but also helped my co-workers with the other aspects too.

Although we were given the option to use our choice of language for this project, our group unanimously agreed to use C# (as the main language). 

C# was the main language of the learning module that this final project was a part of and we felt it would be best to both stick with a familiar language. This allowed us to explore creating more advanced features, rather than learning a new language.

### Other tools used included:
- GitHub
- Slack
- Trello
- Excalidraw

# My Reflections
### One thing I'm proud of
#### Going from no C# to ‘FocusFinder’
Having started learning C# only in late January, with little to no experience in between us prior to this, I was really proud of how advanced an application we built in just 2-weeks.

### One thing I found challenging
#### Controllers (MVC)
Using controllers in C# took a little to get my head around, particularly for the set up of our project.
By the end, this was much clearer thankfully, but I can admit it was one of the slower concepts to grasp.

### One takeaway for my next project
#### To set aside more time for testing
Our one failure in this project was our testing. I believe we finished on a very poor ~40% test coverage, and in all our final reflections we all agreed this was something we all had to do better by in future projects and not leave as an after thought.

### FocusFinder 2.0 - what would I do differently?
#### Accessibility features
If we made FocusFinder again, I would like to dedicate time to ensuring our application meets the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. 
This was something I highlighted in our planning session, and due to the nature of the project being rushed one (only 2-weeks) and also none of us having experience in ensuring accessible web designs, we decided to note this down as an 'Advanced' feature of our project (something we would address if we had enough time later in the project).
